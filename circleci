Mobile CI/CD – Ultra Short Notes
	•	Jenkins starts pipeline and orchestrates
	•	Builds tooling Docker image
	•	Installs Node, Ruby, Bundler, Fastlane
	•	❌ Does NOT run Fastlane lanes
	•	Jenkins triggers CircleCI
	•	CircleCI is the executor
	•	Runs on CircleCI-managed infrastructure (not EKS/AWS)
	•	Uses macOS executor
	•	Fastlane runs ONLY in CircleCI
	•	bundle install
	•	bundle exec fastlane <lane>
	•	Submits app to App Store / Play Store
	•	Why macOS
	•	Required for iOS
	•	Android also runs on macOS

Jenkins orchestrates, CircleCI executes Fastlane on macOS, and Fastlane handles mobile app submission.
